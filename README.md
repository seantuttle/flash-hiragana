Basic flashcard website for learning the Japanese writing system of Hiragana

Built using built-in networking functionality of Go and [gorilla mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux), this basic web application will allow students
who are just beginning to learn Japanese become familiar with the Hiragana writing system. To run this web application, you must have [Go installed](https://go.dev/doc/install).
Once Go is installed, simply run "go run ." from the directory containing main.go, then navigate to localhost:5000 in your browser.
